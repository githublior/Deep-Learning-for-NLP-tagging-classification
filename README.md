# Deep-Learning-for-Text-and-Sequences
Deep Learning for Natural Langage Processing.
Given a text dataset, we had to classify words over Part Of Speech (POS)tagging , and then over Named Entity Recognition (NER)tagging .

This project is composed of two steps:
In the first part, we developped a deep neural network with window based tagging and an embedding vector for the vocabulary.
for reaching higher accuracy, we then worked with sub-word unit. 

This project where part of assignements 2 and 3 of Course Deep Learning for Text and Sequences by prof. Yoav Golberg ,see requirements at http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~89-687/
