# Deep Learning for Natural Langage Processing.

Given a text dataset, we had to classify words over Part Of Speech (POS)tagging , and then over Named Entity Recognition (NER)tagging .

This project is composed of two parts:

First, we developped a deep neural network with window based tagging and an embedding vector over the vocabulary for the classification.
for reaching higher accuracy, we added sub-word unit to feed our model. 

In the second part, we dealt with RNN Acceptors, and added two Bi-LSTM layers to our previous model, to reach higher accuracy.
